📥 Data Management: Easily download a backup of your data or upload it to a new device in the settings.

🚀 How to Use
PinkDays is a single HTML file, which makes it incredibly easy to host for free on GitHub Pages.

Upload the Files: Make sure the index.html file and your pinkdays_transparentlogo.png & pinkdays_logo.png files are in your GitHub repository.

Enable GitHub Pages:

In your repository, go to the Settings tab.

In the left sidebar, click on Pages.

Under "Branch", select main (or master) and click Save.

Visit Your Site: GitHub will provide you with a public URL (like your-username.github.io/your-repository-name). Your PinkDays app will be live at that address!

🔐 Privacy
Your privacy is the top priority. PinkDays is designed to be a completely private experience.

No Server, No Accounts: The app does not connect to any server and does not require you to create an account.

Local Storage Only: All the data you enter is stored only on your device in your browser's local storage. This means you have full control over your information.
